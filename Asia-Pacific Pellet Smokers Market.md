Additionally, the growing trend of backyard cooking and outdoor dining experiences in urban areas is expected to fuel demand for pellet smokers, particularly in countries with favorable climates for outdoor activities year-round.</p><p>Another opportunity lies in the increasing awareness of pellet smokers in commercial foodservice establishments. As restaurants and catering businesses look for ways to differentiate themselves by offering unique and flavorful dishes, pellet smokers present an attractive option.
