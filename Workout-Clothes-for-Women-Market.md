The global e-commerce boom has also contributed to the market’s expansion. Online shopping offers greater convenience, a broader range of product selections, and the ability to compare prices and reviews. Moreover, social media and influencer marketing are helping to drive awareness and brand preference, especially among younger women who are active on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.
