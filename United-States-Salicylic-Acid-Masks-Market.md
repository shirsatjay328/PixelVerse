These masks, when used in a clinical setting, are often combined with other therapies to target specific skin concerns such as acne and oily skin. Dermatologists are able to offer personalized skincare solutions to their patients, ensuring that the salicylic acid treatment aligns with the individual needs of the patient's skin type and condition.</p><p>Salicylic acid masks used by dermatologists typically undergo rigorous formulation and testing, ensuring they are suitable for medical-grade skincare.
