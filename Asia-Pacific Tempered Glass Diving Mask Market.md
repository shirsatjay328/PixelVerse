The online market has seen rapid growth, as e-commerce platforms offer consumers a wide range of diving masks from various brands and at competitive prices. With increasing digital penetration, online sales allow customers to conveniently browse and purchase diving masks from the comfort of their homes. This segment also benefits from customer reviews, product comparisons, and easy access to international brands that may not be available in local stores. Furthermore, online platforms often offer detailed product specifications and visual content, allowing customers to make informed decisions. The convenience, accessibility, and competitive pricing of online shopping have contributed to its growing popularity in the diving gear market.On the other hand, the offline market remains an essential segment, particularly in regions where local retail stores and specialized diving equipment shops are prevalent. Offline sales often attract customers who prefer to physically examine and test the products before making a purchase. Retail stores offer a more personalized shopping experience, where consumers can seek expert advice and recommendations. Moreover, offline sales tend to foster greater brand loyalty as customers can interact directly with representatives and receive immediate customer service. This segment also plays a crucial role in the Asia–Pacific market due to its strong presence in countries with thriving diving communities.
